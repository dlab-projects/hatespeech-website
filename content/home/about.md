The *Measuring Hate Speech* project aims to develop models, datasets, and
theoretical frameworks capable of measuring hate speech.

The majority of work in automated hate speech detection treats hate speech as a
binary phenomenon: a piece of text is either hate speech or is not. This limited
perspective does not account multifaceted nature of hate speech or for
disagreements among individuals as to what constitutes hate speech.

Using Rasch measurement theory, we have developed a continuous *measurement
scale* for hate speech, capable of accomodating annotator perspective. By
combining the measurement scale with large language models, we have developed
tools that can measure the hatefulness of text at scale.

The *Measuring Hate Speech* project began in early 2017 at UC Berkeley's
[D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu). We continue our work on this project, both in
academic research and deploying our expertise, tools, and methods to those who
could benefit from them via consultations. **If you are interested in partnering
