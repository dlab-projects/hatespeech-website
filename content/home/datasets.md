Our datasets and models are freely and openly available on
[HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/ucberkeley-dlab). 

The *Measuring Hate Speech* dataset contains nearly 50,000 annotations, with
over 10,000 unique social media comments (from YouTube, Reddit, and Twitter).
These annotations contain responses to 10 survey items which span our hate
speech construct, information about the targets of the speech, and annotator
demographics.

Our neural network models are also available on HuggingFace. The code for these
models is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dlab-projects/hate_measure).
The code to reproduce the work in our papers are also available on GitHub (see
below).
